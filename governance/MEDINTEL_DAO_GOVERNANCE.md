# DAO_GOVERNANCE.md

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **governance architecture** for the MedIntel DAO, establishing how authority, accountability, and oversight are exercised over AI systems operating in regulated medical contexts.

The DAO exists to:

* Protect patient safety
* Enforce regulatory compliance
* Preserve scientific integrity
* Prevent capture by financial or political interests

---

## 2. Governance Model

MedIntel operates under **Qualified Decentralized Governance**:

* Decentralization of participation
* Centralization of responsibility
* Explicit human accountability at all decision layers

No AI system, smart contract, or token holder may exercise autonomous authority over clinical decisions.

---

## 3. Governing Bodies

### 3.1 Core Governance Council

* Final authority over DAO policy
* Ratifies high-risk and regulated decisions
* Approves model deployment and retirement
* Ensures alignment with regulatory obligations

### 3.2 Safety & Ethics Council

* Can issue binding safety directives
* Holds emergency suspension powers
* Reports directly to regulators if required

### 3.3 Technical Review Board

* Reviews model architecture, training data, and performance
* Validates safety cases and risk assessments
* Advises but does not unilaterally decide

### 3.4 Community & Research Assembly

* Open participation forum
* Non-binding proposals and commentary
* Transparency and accountability channel

## 5. Voting Principles

* Expertise-weighted voting
* Role-based quorum requirements
* Token holdings do not equal control
* Conflicts of interest disqualify voting rights

Clinical and safety decisions always override economic incentives.

## 6. Proposal Lifecycle

1. Submission
2. Compliance screening
3. Public disclosure
4. Expert review
5. Formal vote
6. Ratification
7. Immutable archival

Emergency actions may bypass steps 3–5 with mandatory post-hoc review.

## 7. Emergency Powers

The Safety & Ethics Council may:

* Suspend models
* Freeze data pipelines
* Trigger system rollback

Emergency powers:

* Are time-limited
* Require justification
* Must be reviewed within 72 hours

## 8. Transparency & Auditability

All governance actions are:

* Logged
* Timestamped
* Publicly auditable
* Retained indefinitely

Redactions are permitted only where legally required.

---

## 9. Non-Delegable Responsibilities

The DAO may not:

* Override clinical judgment
* Bypass regulatory obligations
* Conceal adverse outcomes
* Delegate responsibility to AI systems

Human accountability is absolute.
