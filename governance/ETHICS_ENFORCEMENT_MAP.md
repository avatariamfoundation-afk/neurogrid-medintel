# ETHICS_ENFORCEMENT_MAP.md  
**MedIntel Ethics Enforcement, Control Mapping & Accountability Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Ethics Enforcement Map** for MedIntel AI systems.  
Its purpose is to explicitly map **ethical principles to enforceable controls**, ensuring ethics are not aspirational statements but **operationally binding obligations**.

Ethics without enforcement is non-compliance.

---

## 2. Scope

This enforcement map applies to:
- All MedIntel AI models
- All data lifecycle stages
- All clinical and RPM use cases
- All governance, oversight, and DAO interactions
- All human roles interacting with AI outputs

---

## 3. Ethics-to-Control Mapping Principle

Each ethical obligation must have:
- A named enforcement mechanism
- A responsible role or body
- A technical or procedural control
- A verification or audit method
- A defined failure response

Unmapped ethics are invalid.

---

## 4. Core Ethical Domains

MedIntel enforces ethics across the following domains:

- Patient safety
- Human autonomy
- Clinical independence
- Fairness and bias control
- Transparency and truthfulness
- Accountability and traceability
- Non-maleficence
- Regulatory obedience

---

## 5. Ethics Enforcement Matrix

| Ethical Principle | Enforcement Control | Responsible Entity | Verification Method |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Patient Safety | Safety case gating | Safety Council | Audit review |
| Human Oversight | Override enforcement | Clinical Ops | Log inspection |
| Transparency | Disclosure protocols | Governance | Artifact validation |
| Fairness | Bias surveillance | Model Review Board | Bias reports |
| Accountability | Decision trace logs | Compliance | Trace audits |
| Non-Autonomy | Advisory-only constraint | Engineering | Runtime checks |

---

## 6. Technical Enforcement Controls

Ethical enforcement is implemented through:
- Hard-coded system constraints
- Smart contract governance limits
- Mandatory logging and immutability
- Role-based access controls
- Model suspension triggers
- Transparency and disclosure artifacts

Ethical rules may not be bypassed by configuration.

---

## 7. Procedural Enforcement Controls

Procedural controls include:
- Mandatory ethics review checkpoints
- Independent oversight validation
- Conflict-of-interest enforcement
- Incident escalation protocols
- Post-market ethics surveillance

Procedural failures are treated as system failures.

---

## 8. DAO Boundary Conditions

The DAO:
- May not vote to weaken ethical controls
- May not override safety or autonomy constraints
- Must preserve immutable ethics boundaries
- Is subject to ethics enforcement itself

Decentralization does not exempt ethics.

---

## 9. Ethics Breach Classification

| Severity | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Minor | Procedural lapse | Remediation |
| Major | Control failure | Model suspension |
| Critical | Patient risk | Immediate shutdown & notification |

---

## 10. Incident Response for Ethics Violations

Upon detection of an ethics breach:
- AI outputs may be halted
- Evidence is preserved
- Independent review is triggered
- Regulators are notified if required
- Corrective actions are mandatory

---

## 11. Audit & Verification

Ethics enforcement is verified through:
- Scheduled audits
- Triggered inspections
- External oversight reviews
- Immutable evidence trails

Audit obstruction constitutes a governance breach.

---

## 12. Lifecycle Integration

Ethics enforcement applies:
- Pre-deployment
- During operation
- During model updates
- During incidents
- Post-decommissioning

Ethics do not expire.

---

## 13. Recordkeeping

All ethics enforcement artifacts are:
- Version-controlled
- Timestamped
- Immutable
- Retained indefinitely
