# NeuroGrid MedIntel

NeuroGrid MedIntel is the AI engine for post-operative care and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). It integrates wearable and subcutaneous device telemetry, runs generative and predictive models (G-PAS), and produces clinician-ready treatment pathways and alerts. Data flows are privacy-preserving; outputs are verifiable and auditable.

Key focus:
- Wearable + subcutaneous device ingestion
- Predictive models for complications and readmission
- Generative treatment plans and HCP copilot outputs
- Integration points for hospital systems and device vendors
